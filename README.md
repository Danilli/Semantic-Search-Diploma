# Semantic-Search-Diploma
It is a my diploma project where I had to create the desktop application Semantic Search

In the course of the work, the basic concepts and methods of text analysis were studied, and the existing approaches to the creation of semantic search systems were also considered. An intelligent semantic information retrieval system was developed using the Python programming language. It is based on NLP algorithms and libraries, which allows you to quickly and efficiently search for information in the company's text corpus.

The subject area is the Analysis of textual information, whose key difficulty lies in the impossibility of distinguishing semantically and ontological relationships by formal rules. Those. immunity of modern computer technologies to the semantic load of unstructured data and informal (natural) languages.

One of the most important sections of Data mining is semantic search, which has become the object of research for this thesis. Semantic search researchers strive to improve the quality of search engines and increase the relevance of the search engine results to the user's query. Semantic search engines using special statistical algorithms, heuristic techniques and machine learning algorithms extract the meanings of the query and documents in the corpus for better results.

The subject of the study was "Intellectual system of semantic information retrieval in the company's text corpus". To begin with, a definition was given for intelligent systems, semantic search, corpus of texts in the context of the specifics of companies. Then, ready-made solutions for the implemented system and ready-made technologies are considered, with the help of which semantic search engines are built. Developed requirements for our own system.
During the work, current development problems were identified, such as the lack of open access to ready-made databases for compiling a corpus of the necessary topics, the lack of examples of the practical implementation of such systems, and the lack of interest in innovation among businesses. The trends of the listed problems have begun to change only in the last few years, so the problem is still acute.

Finding a dataset relevant to the task became a fundamental problem. The dataset was required in duplicate and preferably with a non-overlapping set of documents: for training and for testing the effectiveness of the system. The problem has been not completely solved, but alternative databases have been used, as well as algorithms from data science to increase and mix the training sample.

The practical part of the work showed that the developed semantic search system is capable of increasing the relevance of the issuance and increasing the efficiency of the company's employees. For this conclusion, we tested the resulting output of an already implemented third-party system and the one created in the framework of this work. The intelligent system implemented in the framework of this work turned out to be more efficient.

The mathematical apparatus was used to confirm the reliability of the code base of the intelligent system. In particular, the Mills formula was used, which finds the probability that the program has errors based on the number of errors already found. Because of the calculations, a result of 73 percent was obtained, that there were no errors left in the system, which is a good indicator.

Thus, the created Intelligent Semantic Search System in the company's text corpus based on the Python programming language and NLP algorithms is an effective tool for automating the information retrieval process and increasing the relevance of the issue. The results of the system showed that it can be useful for various types of companies and organizations where a large amount of information is being searched.

In further research on this topic, it is possible to improve the semantic search system by adding new algorithms and methods for analyzing texts, as well as expanding its capabilities to work with various types of data. In addition, you can consider using the system to analyze texts in social networks and other open sources of information.
